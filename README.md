Quizzes for the PaFlo app

<h1>How do I write a quiz?</h1>
A quiz must contain at least three questions.

A quiz xml needs to be in the form of <b>vorlageQuiz.xml</b> (see this Repo) to be parsed correctly. 
Just 
copy the content of the form, 
find a quizname, a filename and your own questions and answers
and fill it in the form!

If you want to share your quiz with everyone, optionally add your .xml-file to this Repo. 

Afterwards, you can choose. You can either just ping on us so that we can refresh the quizIndex.xml.
Or you click on the file and then on "Raw". Copy the url and then open quizIndex.xml. Add your quiz in the there shown form.

Congrats :)
Now everybody can see, download and do your quiz!
